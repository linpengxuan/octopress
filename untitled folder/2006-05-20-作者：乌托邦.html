<p><div id="msgcns!3725CC0EE38B1F6!1105" class="bvMsg">已经是第二次看这部电影了。 a man for all seasons. <br /><br />then did I find out this is one of the best movies ever according to some objective standards. <br /><br />that I was a convinced again by the beauty of his simplicity yet confident and reasonable tones.<br /><br />that again I have questioned myself wow, still a long way to go with no signs of ending.<br /><div style="width:477px;"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/53/149549046_ee1d1d8931.jpg?v=0" alt="" height="346" width="475" /></div><br /><br />It is already beyond some conflict between fire and bloods, sometimes, words can touch your sense much more than what you thought. and poor hollywood and shallow me, besides, after a whole bunch of years developing, what they can present to us are nothing but sound and images.<br /><br />Then I did a little bit research. u guys know the little annoying and ugly Richard Rich in the movie, he is the one that plays as Chancellor again in you know what, V for Vendetta.<br /><br /><br /><br />Sir Thomas More (1477 - 1535)</div></p>

<p>Thomas More - lawyer, prolific writer, MP and statesman - was Chancellor of England between 1529 and 1532. He rose to prominence early in the 16th century as Under-sheriff of London and one of Henry VIII's most effective and trusted civil servants, acting as the King's secretary, interpreter, speech-writer, chief diplomat, advisor and confidant. In 1521 he was made the Kingdom's Undertreasurer and knighted, and in 1523 he became the Speaker of the House of Commons.</p>

<p>At the same time More was building up a reputation as one of Europe's leading scholars. He was close to the radical catholic theologian Erasmus, but wrote polemics against Martin Luther and the protestant reformation. Around 1515 he wrote The History of Richard III which established that king's reputation as a tyrant and has been described as the first masterpiece of English historiography; and in 1516 published his most important work Utopia - a description of an imaginary communist republic ruled by reason and intended to contrast sharply with the strife-ridden reality of contemporary Europe politics.</p>

<p>Despite his own free-thinking, More was a passionate defender of Catholic orthodoxy - writing pamphlet after pamphlet against heresy, banning and confiscating unorthodox books, and even taking personal responsibility when Chancellor for the interrogation, whipping and burning of English heretics.</p>

<p>More took on the post of Lord Chancellor just when King Henry had become determined to obtain a divorce from Catherine of Aragon, something forbidden by church law. The previous Chancellor, Lord Wolsey, had failed to achieve this objective, Henry was close to breaking with the Church of Rome, and the so-called 'Reformation Parliament' was about to convene. More was opposed to Henry's policy.</p>

<p>When Henry declared himself 'Supreme Head of the Church in England' - thus establishing the Anglican Church and allowing him to set aside his marriage - More resigned the Chancellorship to be replaced as the King's main advisor by Thomas Cromwell. He continued to argue against the King's divorce and the split with Rome, and in 1534 was arrested after refusing to swear an Oath of Succession repudiating the Pope and accepting the annulment of the marriage to Catherine. Fifteen months later More was tried for treason at Westminster, and on July 6th 1535 he was executed by beheading on Tower Hill.</p>

<p>In 1935 Thomas More was recognised as a catholic saint.<br /><br /><img alt="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/6305252564.01._PE33_.A-Man-for-All-Seasons._SCLZZZZZZZ_.jpg" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/6305252564.01._PE33_.A-Man-for-All-Seasons._SCLZZZZZZZ_.jpg" /><br /></p>
