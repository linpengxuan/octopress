  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here the story begins Being there in the middle of Autumn, we found the
concern of the weather could be one of the reasons why we went earlier than
the last year’s schedule. In other words, our schedule fits us, it wasn&#8217;t
neither too hot nor extreme cold. To our surprise, we didn&#8217;t use umbrella or
thick jacket a lot during 3 weeks as we were told of unpredictable climate by
our seniors. However, what we haven&#8217;t foreseen is have to walk all the time,
started and ended in our institute in Chantily-Gouvieux, from 7 am to 7 pm
sometimes, the only time-break was enjoyed during our lunch time in University
Restaurant everyday. I would be really exaggerate or hypocrite to say we did
enjoy everyday. sometimes the cases would be that we started in the early
morning when it was still dark, come back at 5 or 6, prepared food for the
rest of students and most of all, washed all the dishes till 11 o&#8217;clock due to
unexperienced skill. As time flied, those small and tedious things become part
of our lives and we did cherish them. We had problems dealing with everything,
by solving them with Myungkun and other doctor students, we also became closer
friends. Besides, isn&#8217;t dealing and solving the problem one of the virtues and
characters future leader should bear? We, 30 students along with Doctor
students and staff Mr. Kim, were divided into 4 groups, where all non-
graduate students were assigned to group 4. for the first 3 groups, we were
responsible for cooking and cleaning turn by turn, 3 days around. Also, a
voting system was introduced to increase the competition aiming at a higher
quality of service, it worked as quoted from some economic
textbook,”competitions are good, competitions observe the rules in market”. By
doing so, all the dinner seemed to be more diversified as coming to the end of
the field study under the guide of all the chefs and cooks in 3 groups, an
indication of fiercer competition among one another, although with a shortage
of food supplied when we were informed of the avian flu sporadically found in
European Continent, which cut the chicken off the list, and a not-too-much
budget over dinner. We were proud of this, for one thing, we could have more,
second, more cooperation among us with an understanding for each other, thus
resulted in strengthening the friendship, as I mentioned in acknowledgment.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Couple days ago, when I held my birthday party in Pingpong room, I addressed
to my juniors, my classmates and our doctor students, never do I feel so close
to each other as brothers and sisters, never do I realize the gap between
Chinese and non-Chinese group could be narrowed down to an almost non-existent
level after European Field Study. Those are some extra benefits we gained from
the trip, which, thanks to TLBU multinational education system, also provides
us an opportunity to broad our vision abroad, refine our leadership, increase
our regional cooperation between Asia countries and our European counterparts
to a higher level. Words need no more, but thanks, Mr. President.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My deer Pam_pam,</p>

<p>probably you have figured out ,ewuuu, stupid pengxuan, misspelling dear. Well
,no , that is what I meant to. You are welcome. you don&#8217;t know how much we
miss u and personally how much i miss u. always said to myself, i would write
u a long letter, taking this as a consideration, you won&#8217;t feel so sad when u
just get an I know from my last reply to u, as i am doing redemption
now,hahah&#8230;. i guess this is a quite cool start, isn&#8217;t it? don&#8217;t laugh, i
know you would agree from the bottom of ur heart.hahah&#8230;.(i laugh again) i
think i am obligated to have u known what happened in France. Yes. Riots.
Hahah&#8230;. actually, we did a really good job in dealing with all our problems
including, moving in group, curfew, speaking english, even interacting with
Myungkun(i myself sacrifice my face several times to get kisses from him, now
i know his name is disgusting myungkun)&#8230;. we have our friendship enhanced.
And this could probably be the first time i feel the chemistry between
brothers and sisters (I mean altogether) in TLBU, and also manage to
understand more about President and his ambition. Hope u are healthy, and you
juniors are good , thanks to me, you know. And say hello to your family if
they still remember me&#8230;&#8230;ahhahahahahahahahah.. again you are welcome.
sincerely, mighty Pengxuan</p>

<p>I would also like to express my gratitude to all my group members, you are
always generous and supportive to all the other members. With the same feeling
as Both and khieng, I would like to keep this good time into my memory as a
token not for the past but a brand new start. So why not we, you know, keep
doing kitchen things later, we got chef, we got cleaning team we got
supermarket here, why not.</p>

<p>And I hate to say this, but you guys are sweet.</p>

<p>Both</p>

<p>Dear all my lovely members,</p>

<p>I am delighted to be one of the members in groupe I, because we have a great</p>

<p>people in our group and at the same time i have leaned alot from all of you.</p>

<p>it was a sweet memories for me to share this precious moment with all of you</p>

<p>(successful future leaders). I really mean it:)</p>

<p>I personally would like to say sorry to all our group members of any</p>

<p>unintentional mistakes that i had made during the field study and other</p>

<p>times and i hope that no one got hurt ha&#8230;? because i used to play alot</p>

<p>with our group members.</p>

<p>Op&#8230;., i tell you one thing i am trying to be a better man now? do you</p>

<p>think so?</p>

<p>Nothing to hide in my heart:)</p>

<p>I love you all of my heart</p>

<p>Triple B</p>

<p>Huy Khieng</p>

<p>Dear all,</p>

<p>I totally agree with Liao Li on your effort and cooperation to make this field
study the best one, especially for our group 1. Everyone has different
specialty, but all together make the group and the whole field study
enjoyable, fruitful and, more importantly, wonderfull.</p>

<p>Forgive me for not being able to mention the effort each of you made during
the field study (for I am not very good at praising people :)))  ) I cherish
and keep every of your good things, good characteristics, kindness&#8230;. in my
mind and heart rather than speaking them out, but as some of you have
experienced that I would talk something I don&#8217;t like about you face to face.
Therefore, forgive me for all the mistakes I made, anger I had, inconvenience
I caused&#8230; to all of you so far.</p>

<p>Honestly, I was very worried about joining group 1 at first. The reason is
that I am too negatively serious and sober, cannot provide any fun and happy
environment, do not have a very friendly and good relationship with all of you
(100%). In other words, I have quite different characteristics from most of
you. That&#8217;s totally my problem. Fortunately, I have learnt a lot from each of
you. Though I cannot change myself totally as what president mentioned in the
meeting (less individualistic or be examplar), I am very happy to learn from
you this time and would be very very extra grateful for your effort and
example to keep changing me.</p>

<p>Enjoy the our TLBU family relationship!</p>

<p>Very Best Regards,</p>

<p>Khieng</p>

<p>liao li</p>

<blockquote><p>Dear group 1 members,</p>

<p>  Finally we came back and enjoyed our field study together.I was</p>

<p>very happy to be with all of you.During this one month, I saw that</p>

<p>all of you have many shining spots.I learned much from you and thank</p>

<p>you for all of your help.Everything we did was the best,I believe.</p>

<p>  Thanks for our Tu-co&#8217;s contribution and sacrifice,especially the</p>

<p>duck,hehe.Thanks for Khieng and peiyang&#8217;s effort to find the right</p>

<p>way every time.Thanks for pengxuan&#8217;s carefully taking care of</p>

<p>everybody on the way and the great cleaning job.Thanks for Both&#8217;s</p>

<p>kind-hearted taking pictures for all of us and cutting chicken and</p>

<p>meat,we felt very happy to be with you.Thanks for Jiani&#8217;s great</p>

<p>washing dishes with pengxuan and we enjoyed ur beauty in the</p>

<p>trip.Thanks for Queen&#8217;s delicious food cooking and should punish you</p>

<p>for making us all get weight especially my stomach felt</p>

<p>angry,hehe(joking:) ).Thanks for tiantian&#8217;s best serving on the</p>

<p>table and ur computer for me and Queen.Thanks for qiulin&#8217;s chinese</p>

<p>dishes and ur smile on your red tomato face,hehe.And at last also</p>

<p>thanks for my best cutting and my quickest eating,oh,also my 2</p>

<p>birhtday cakes,hehe.</p>

<p>  Finally I suggest all of us first pick out our individual pictures</p>

<p>keeping by ourselves and collect all the pictures of the others and</p>

<p>then send them to Both. After Both received , he can send all to</p>

<p>each of us. We can choose by ourselves.</p>

<p>  Group 1, the best!</p>

<p>  Enjoy ur time ~_~</p>

<p>  Love you all!</p>

<p>         LIAO LI</p></blockquote>
