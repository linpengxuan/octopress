  <div class="entry-content"><p>这两个月跑步，知道我跑了多长嘛？</p>

<p>呵呵，不好意思，不长也不短，我跑了2百公里。</p>

<p>这是我的体重从170斤降到现在的140斤的最佳解释了。</p>

<p>Believe or not。</p>

<p>最初跑步是为了LSAT服务的，因为我相信如果每天的跑步能够坚持下来，那就没有什么坚持不下来了。可惜，跑步喧宾夺主，是坚持下来了，可LSAT给放下了。似乎还会
有上瘾的感觉，要是不跑，心里觉得非常不舒服。</p>

<p>于是我就开始变得专业了。添置了专门的跑步鞋，衣服，手表。很high.</p>

<p>LSAT:我现在就像是在一个黑屋子里，只要下狠心，就能够找到出路，可惜我缓下来了。我相信，我会振作的，就像跑步一样。</p>

<p>添上两张照片，很酷的跑步者和我的小孩腕表。</p>

<p>It is the anniversaries of the Last Supper. I went to church again.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I might not worthy to receive your love, but only say the words and I should
be healed.</p>

<p>Thy kingdom will come. Thy will be done on earth as it is done in heaven. Give
us these days our daily bread, And forgive us our trespass, As we forgive
those who trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation, But deliver us
from evil.</p>

<p>It is not an easy job to recourse the way Jesus did thousands years ago from
the Pontius Pilate’s sanction to the Calvary where he is nailed to dearth on
the cross, especially for me, a new comer eager to know the secret of
Christianity.</p>

<p>There are 15 stations according to the 15 times Jesus fell down during that
course. We read the liturgy each stop of the station.</p>

<p>I can’t say more using such words to have the situation misunderstood. It is
more about a traveling in one’s own soul. Unless you do it yourself, it will
be just like that you read something somewhere for 15 times, one can not
always knows what these mean.</p>

<p>Father, forgive them. For they don’t know what they are doing now.</p>

<p>in the name of the father, the son and the holy spirit. Have you heard of this
before, might be in the Churches, movies or somewhere else. Do you know what
it means. I suppose the answer is no. they call it Trinity. Kinda of being
familiar with that, you are right, the same name of that woman who save the
Neo in Matrix. Same reason about the religion implication leaking from that
movie, no wonder that Brothers want to confuse us from the ideology and
fiction. Trinity, a magic word, is all enough to explain the myth and secrecy
of the Announcement of the immaculate conception form Virgin Mary by Angel.
Indeed, it is already enough. But sorry, I know it, I DON’T WANT TO SHARE IT.
FOR those of you want to know, why not find yourself. I just don’t want to
waste another chance to enlarge your own knowledge or wake up your appetite to
know this new world which never open to China nowadays.</p>

<p>Same old world. I am still seeking for my belief.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over thousands of years, people dream about the flying high in the sky,
experiencing something that seems only possible to the birds. Not until the
Wright brothers’ engine-powered flight in 1903 did people start to set foot
somewhere other than earth after thousands of attempts and trying, if we take
balloon flight out of this area. Suddenly a new era was started, economically,
politically, or militarily, not to mention the roles that aircrafts played
during World War II.</p>

<p>But that is not enough, people wanted to learn more, wanted to have more. Even
dated back to 1865, a book entitled: De la Terra à la Lune, written by Verne,
depicted an imagination emerge from the realms of fantasy: man’s first entry
into outer space in fiction. The development of the aircrafts ensures the
possible and basic requirement for the outer space travel. During the years
preceding World War II significant progress in space technology was made in
countries like Germany, the USSR and the USA. The enormous accumulated
experiences gained during the war finally lead to a breakthrough in outer
space in 1957, when Sputnik I became the first satellite to orbit the earth in
outer space. In April 1961, Yuri Gagarin completed the first manned space
flight, and in 1969 Neil Armstrong became the first human being to set foot on
another celestial body, the moon. It had, by then, already become apparent
that legal rules were indispensable if confusion and undesirable practices in
the use of outer space were to be avoided. In the wake of burgeoning space
technology, space law soon became a reality.</p>

<p>It would not be exaggerate to say that what Wright brothers did for the air
law, the Sputnik I did for outer space law, although there could be no doubt
that the International Geophysical Year celebrated from 1957-58 also made a
vital contribution. On 18 Dec 1958, the United Nations General Assembly
recognized the need for international cooperation and for conventions
establishing the rule of peaceful use of outer space, in conformity with
Article 2, section 1, of the UN Charter. On 12 Dec 1959, an “ad hoc” committee
was installed by the UN to deal with the legal problems of involvement in
space activities as they emerged. “The Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer
Space” was set up by the General Assembly in 1959 (resolution 1472 (XIV)) to
review the scope of international cooperation in peaceful uses of outer space,
to devise programmes in this field to be undertaken under United Nations
auspices, to encourage continued research and the dissemination of information
on outer space matters, and to study legal problems arising from the
exploration of outer space. In 1961 the UN adopted a Resolution stipulating
explicitly that only peaceful use of outer space was to be permitted. Another
key provision was that appropriation by Stated was prohibited in outer space.
A further Resolution was adopted on the same subject two years later,
“Declaration of Legal Principles Governing the Activities of States in the
Exploration and Use of Outer Space”. The principles laid down in the
Resolution were to form the basic elements of the so-called “Space Treaty” of
1967. This UN-sponsored Treaty, which entered into force on 10 Oct, 1967, is
the cornerstone on which a number of space law conventions of later date have
been based. Taken together they constitute the nucleus of space law as it
stands today.</p>

<p>Now we come to a very practical problem. Why do we need law about outer space?
Outer space is an exciting and highly important region, which because of its
unique nature holds the potential for both significant benefits and dangers.
The primary goals of space law are to ensure a rational, responsible approach
to the exploration and use of outer space for the benefit and in the interests
of all humankind. To this end, space law addresses a variety of diverse
matters, such as military activities in outer space, preservation of the space
and Earth environment, liability for damages caused by space objects,
settlement of disputes, protection of national interests, rescue of
astronauts, sharing of information about potential dangers in outer space, use
of space-related technologies, and international cooperation. What I said
above is more like an official answer for the reality. Actually, there do have
other reasons we believe to formulate the principle of all human kind. It is
at the cold war that we have codified the outer space law. Without a legal
binding document in outer space, no one would ensure, then two superpower
countries could keep the temptation of using nuclear power in the outer space
against each other, which would result in a disaster to all the human kind.
Also, during 1960s, due to the technology barriers, only two countries were
capable to launch a project in outer space. For the rest countries in the
world, the desire to outer space is not accordingly reflected in the ability
to outer space. Without the international treaties of outer space, by the time
they are capable to do so, no rooms could be left for them. Exactly same thing
happen hundred years ago, the occupation of colonies. England becomes an un-
sunset empire benefiting from the colonies. For some people, a repeating
wrongfully history is, apparently, not what they want to see. Third reason,
where there are human beings’ activities, where are conflicts. Where are
conflicts, where we need regulation. It is better than nothing that we have
such regulations. Also, we look into the character of the science development.
We don’t know what exactly we will have, what we know is that we will have
something. By developing the space science, will of course benefit the
countries. This creates another reason justifying the existence of outer space
law.</p>

<p>记得那时我是在乡下读幼儿园。期末了，老师评出优秀的同学，在学校大会上表彰，并且给予一个小水壶的奖励。那时的情形是这样的，幼儿园和小学是并在一起的，因此约乎有
300人吧，记不清，反正站了N排，我给了个数字，就三百吧。水壶也不是什么东西，当时改革开放的大浪还没有真正掀到我们这个名副其实的rural
areas，质量也不是很好，设计不能说是很没品味，so so吧。不知哪根筋断了弦，当着大伙的面，大喊，老师，我怎么没有。我怎么没有。</p>

<p>我喊到了一个，最后。</p>

<p>第一，童言无忌。第二，脸皮相当厚。第三，也正是因为不了解形势才敢这样做，现在，哼，死一边去吧我。</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>今天整理以前的文件，突然发现了一篇当初去崇明岛的日记。呵呵，知道你们的工作辛苦，希望，这篇小文字会让你们轻松一点点。</p>

<p>电子化了以后，想要写日记的欲望就越来越少了，以为就只有这一项是这样，突然发觉对很多东西的感觉都在逐渐退潮。这是更年期的宗症吗？不知道，也许只是太消极了，已经
开始走吴鸣的路了，找不到了，迷失了。</p>

<p>你以为我写得是什么吗，煽情的吗，错了，我只是在做着三年级时语文老师教我的欲扬先抑的手法!我昨天很开心，应该是一直到现在。</p>

<p>不想说什么具体的，我们迎着海风听着吉他唱着久违了很长时间的歌曲，我们回到了小时候，大家之间没有任何可以隐瞒的东西，我喜欢这种纯洁，如果它被叫做纯洁的话。我们
拿起水枪，冲着，跳着，不管衣服是否湿了，唯一的目的就是让对方被我们打得追着跑；我们挤在一张床上听着另一张床上的人讲着鬼的故事，听到司机也不见了，就被吓得一动
不动的感觉，我喜欢；我们一起看着白天拍下来的场面，回味着，刹那间，自己也上了电视。</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some sudden thoughts.</p>

<p>1, I got my transcripts today. It is reasonable and acceptable to me, at
least, a 3.63/4.5 is out of my expectation and far more out weighed than what
I got before in China. Still, comparing with other person, I was puzzled and
dizzy. I wonder why, those persons who spoke less in class, less participated
in class, and did less can get higher score than me. Or, the fairness in a law
school, which should be the last one to lose this dignity, is dying. One
question pondering and hovering in my head the whole afternoon. Suddenly, I am
cleared. The answer is, that is the world. Either I am one of’em, or out
of’em.</p>

<p>2, some kind of excitement, I am feeling now. Wanna know why? I am going to do
Presentation tomorrow. Wow, yeah, to some students, they are afraid of this
like the fire to water. For me, haha, totally the other way around. Just enjoy
that feeling when I am standing in front of all the persons, noticing them
watching me without blinking their eyes. What more do I want other than
respect? Han, baby.</p>

<p>3, still searching for the light in the tunnel of LSAT.</p>

<p>4, loophole.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hi, how are u?</p>

<p>This is Lin Pengxuan, if you didn’t forget, yeah, you are right, I am your
teacher in TLBU English camp.</p>

<p>Allow me to explain why I wrote this mail to you.</p>

<p>This is a marketing promoting letter, try to ask you guys join in our TLBU
summer camps. Usually I don’t do this, ‘cos kind of contradict to my
principle. But I was asked to do so by our President. Now you know why.</p>

<p>So if this email bothers u, fine. Put it in the Junk Mail box, and I promise I
will never send the same thing again. But still, I think some aspects are
worthy mention.</p>

<p>Some reasons you need to know about learning English,</p>

<p>Keep constantly practicing your English. A better English environment will of
course benefit you in improving it. Stay away with thinking in a Korea way.</p>

<p>Do you talk to yourself in English everyday for 15 minutes? Do you write down
the new vocabularies that you don’t know? Do you enjoy the Hollywood movies
without watching the subtitles? Well, if you do. Fine, I don’t think you need
to come to the mountain again. But if the answer is no, I recommend you come
here, why not?</p>

<p>At least, you want to learn English better, don’t you?</p>

<p>Once again, sorry to write this letter to bother you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Due to the time limit, we are going to present you the essence of this case.
There of course will be some aspects we are not going to cover, but that does
not mean they are not important.</p>

<p>On 5 February 1996, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico and the United States
acting jointly and severally, requested consultations with the European
Communities regarding the EC regime for the importation, sale and distribution
of bananas.</p>

<p>As we all have learnt in last class, the consultation between Complaining
party and Respondent party is necessary to the Procedure of Panel Report.
Which means that only by failing a consultation between two parties can resort
the case to Panel.</p>

<p>On 14, 15 March, 1996, consultations were held but left an unsatisfied result.
Then a panel was established by the said countries to resolve the matter.</p>

<p>So here the question is WHAT IS THE MATTER?</p>

<p>To know a better fact of this case, a basic introductory of the importation,
sale and distribution of bananas of EC regime would be necessary.</p>

<p>I would like to introduce some concepts. ACP countries, countries from
African, Caribbean, Pacific region, which signed Fourth Lomé Convention with
EC. Under this agreement, the importation of bananas is regulated.</p>

<p>BFA stands for Framework Agreement on Bananas, an agreement between EC and
Colombia, Costa Rica, Venezuela and Nicaragua concerning the size of the basic
tariff quota, the in-quota tariff (ECU 75 per tonne), country-specific
allocations and transferability of those allocations.</p>

<p>ECU is a monetary unit, which later is replaced by Euro.</p>

<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;- In 1994, the EC was the world&#8217;s second largest importer of bananas. All of importation is under charge of common market organization for bananas, which replace the various national banana import regimes.<br/>
Basically, it establishes three categories of imports:</p>

<p>(i) Traditional imports from twelve ACP countries;</p>

<p>(ii) Non-traditional imports from ACP countries which are defined as both any
quantities in excess of traditional quantities supplied by traditional ACP
countries and any quantities supplied by ACP countries which are not
traditional suppliers of the EC; and</p>

<p>(iii) Imports from third (non-ACP) countries.</p>

<p>What are difference treatments between these 3 categories?</p>

<p>For the 1st category, it is all duty free. No tariff at all.</p>

<p>2nd category. Duty free in a certain amount, for the quantities exceeding the
amount, ECU 693 per ton for out of quota importation.</p>

<p>3rd one, ECU 75 per ton for in-quota importation. ECU 793 per ton for out-of-
quota importation.</p>

<p>Did you see the difference treatment between this 3 categories? Yes, kind of
discriminatory, isn’t it? At least, it is not according to MFN.</p>

<p>Also, all the importation of bananas subjects to the licensing procedures.</p>

<p>For the 1st category, ACP imports, it requires a certificate of country of
origin.</p>

<p>But 2nd and 3rd categories, subject to: (i) allocation of licences based on
three operator categories; (ii) allocation of licences according to three
activity functions; (iii) export certificate requirements for imports from
Costa Rica, Colombia and Nicaragua; and (iv) a two-round quarterly procedure
to administer licence applications.</p>

<p>It is much easier for traditional ACP imports license and more difficult and
complicated for the 2nd and 3rd categories.</p>

<p>Above all are the basic facts of the case, also the reason why US, along with
other countries filed a suit against the EC. US is not a traditional banana
producer, but a banana industry investor.</p>

<p>The arguments are concerning about 3 issues:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>tariff issue. The tariff quota&#8217;s tariff structure was challengeable because
it imposed differential rates as between third-country bananas on the one
hand, and non-traditional ACP bananas on the other. A serious contradiction to
the GATT&#8217;s most fundamental guarantee of &#8220;non-discriminatory tariff treatment&#8221;
set forth in Article I:1.</p></li>
<li><p>allocation issue. EC is allocating the market share of bananas to the
countries from which bananas are imported. To get straight, some countries,
basing on the Lome Convention and BFA agreement, some countries get more
favourable treatments in importation from EC, while others don’t.</p></li>
<li><p>import licensing issue.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>As I told you before, in the fact introductory, the licensing systems is
highly complex, which creates: (i) Highly unfavourable conditions of
application for categories 2 and 3 comparing to the simple procedure of
category 1. (ii) even between categories 2 and 3, a more favourable condition
including the in-quota quantity, tariff rate is granted to the ACP countries
than third countries.</p>

<p>It is very clear now that case is concerning about the discriminatory
treatment. A very contradiction to the fundamental principle of then GATT.</p>
