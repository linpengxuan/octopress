They're nude a lot, too. If this isn't<span style="color:rgb(255,0,0);"> cultural terrorism</span>, I don't know what is.<br /></p><p><br /></p><p><img alt="http://whatsupnyc.com/blog/archives/jackass2.JPG" src="http://whatsupnyc.com/blog/archives/jackass2.JPG" />

 </p><p><span style="font-size:12pt;">What above mentioned is a movie I watched along with Borat last month. I couldn't say it isn't unique, from a very very special perpective. I mean, if u never felt like to vomit during a movie, well, this is your chance. For me. It just dammit grossy. Ewl…….
</span></p><p>
 </p><p><span style="font-size:12pt;">I still remembered that night, I just directly closed the movie after it was played on for 10 minutes. After that, I sat on my bed for another 10, with unrestrained curiosity, I opened the prog to watch it again to see how bad one's imagination could be, I have to tell you, they beat me in my face.

 </p><p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Also the Borat, the film was rated was one of the best in 2006 by Time. Won't say something more, but to cite one or two spots, in case u wonder what movie is this.</span></p><p><br /><span style="font-size:12pt;"></span></p><p><img alt="http://images.apple.com/moviesxml/s/fox/posters/borat_l200606301554.jpg" src="http://images.apple.com/moviesxml/s/fox/posters/borat_l200606301554.jpg" />  <img alt="http://ffmedia.ign.com/filmforce/image/article/711/711738/borat-20060607053153666-000.jpg" src="http://ffmedia.ign.com/filmforce/image/article/711/711738/borat-20060607053153666-000.jpg" /></p><p>
 </p><p><span style="font-size:12pt;">In the first secene, he introduced his family members to us, the audience (it is a quasi-documentary). Then he went to a woman, not bad looking, he kissed her for a long time, trust me, a long time, so when everybody thought that could be his wife, he just turned around, introduced the one he just kissed was his sister…ewll….shit……..
</span></p><p>
 </p><p><span style="font-size:12pt;">The other scence, he visit a rodeo ground, said sth like these, we khazak totally on the side of President Bush on his war on terro, u know, those places really like ones in Texas, they are conservatives, they support Bush, so they just applauded when they heard this, and then after another long and dulling talk, Borat suggested to sing the national Anthem altogether. No one would say no, so he started first…. With his <span style="color:rgb(204,0,51);">Khazakistan anthem </span>

 </p><p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Gosh, u just don't know how funny could that be!</span></p></div></p>
