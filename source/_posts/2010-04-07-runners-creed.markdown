这是从@hecaitou的推上看到的。我非常喜欢。

  

推荐看优酷的视频。

我现在每两天跑一次步，希望把这个背下来。跑步之前念一遍。

This is my  run.

there are many others like it

but this one is mine

my run is my heaven,it's my life

I must master it as I must master my life

without  me,my run is nothing

without my run,I'm nothing

I must run this road, it's true

I must run faster than the stress of the world that's working to drag me down

I must outrun stress before it overruns me,I will

I swear to this creed,my run and I are defender of my sanity.

we're the master of my bodywe're the saviors of my life

so  be it,

until victory is mine,

and nothing remains but peace.

  

  


我要跑下去。。。
