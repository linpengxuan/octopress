Commencement keynote by Lin Pengxuan

How many roads must a man take before we can call him a man? I take this lyric
for your leaving. With an intensive and extensive course here, you are able
and will do things better. you and us are the rising sun in the morning, but
please bear in mind, there’s still a long way ahead of us. Today, we sit
together here in Auditorium to see and celebrate our seniors’ achievement in
last 2 years, to wish and pray for their better promising future. And of
course, to sing Alma mata, once again. One year, is the period of time we
spent in this beautiful campus together. One year, is also the time we share
our joy, sadness, happiness, love together. There is no need to mention your
kindly helping us how to start a new life here; your well prepared parties for
us; your successful field study in Europe; even, our working together in
English camp, hand in hand. In a word, we are brothers and sisters. Anytime
you feel down or frustration, please tell yourself, you have the support from
our juniors, our professors, our beloved president and all the members of TLBU
family as well. It’s the TLBU mission, regional cooperation and world peace
that brought us together. Remember this, and spread this spirit in your life.

Thank you.
