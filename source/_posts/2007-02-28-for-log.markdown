I was informed your mother's passed away this morning. I am sorry for that.

  
 As far as I remembered, I met her once when Yasujeon went into business,
though no communication then, we still could feel what a kind-hearted and
strong women she was. I also know she will ascend to the heaven, praying for
you and TLBU from above as we do here. so please don't be too sad for this, it
is the physical departure that kept us away, not spiritual...

  
and I will pray for her next time I go to Mass.
