今天听了本小说《the confession of an EHM》，里面对Muslim的世界观有个说法。

The Americans want to take control the whole world. And now it could not be a
better time doing it for it is already pretty much close to that point. USSR
may stand on its way, but will prove to be destructive.(it was been proved in
1990) the competition in the future would not between the communism and
capitalism but a war of faith, a war between Muslim and Christian. History has
proved this several times. Ideology couldn't do anything, take a look at USSR,
it has no substance, no economy, no faith, it was set up to doom. There are no
other things in the world more faithful than Muslim world. So right now we
wait, till we grow stronger, then we fight like a snake......

  

oops.听到这心里都有一阵异样的感觉，联系到最近的丹麦政治漫画。突然感觉拉登的做法不过是Muslim世界里的一种极端，但是却体现了这种思想的一种行为。

  

EHM，economy hit man. Usually disguise as employee of multinational corporation
been deployed over the world after world war II when arms conflict prove to be
not a good solution in resolving dispute related to resource in cold war
times. When they failed their mission, and their successor fail either, say,
jack man, war would be the final but only solution. The first and second gulf
war, the 1967 war between Israel and Egypt....

  

following is another excerpt by Bill Clinton who cited from Mr. Churchill.
American would always find the best way to solve the problem only after it
exhaustive all the other alternatives.

  

and do we have to?
