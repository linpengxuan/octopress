Well, this was straight to the point. Finally Hollywood seems to be over their
boring (hoping for Oscar) drama movies. Good old Cruise returning as Ethan
Hunt is what you will see here. Action consisting of explosions, clever bombs,
helicopter chases, flashbacks to True Lies without spoiling too much, evil
villains, heartbreaking stunts and a pretty okay script is what you can
expect.

  
Some predictable scenes, but the fast paced action made the effort worth it
with some very welcome ideas. You also got to love the scenery. Berlin,
Vatikan and China is refreshing to see.

  
007 look out, hard to match this one!

  
Long time since I had such fun at the cinema.
