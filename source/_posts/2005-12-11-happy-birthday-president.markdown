To begin today's blog, let me ask you a question. Could you please tell me
what you would feel at your 60th birthday? eh... hard to say. Yeah, that is a
good thing about being a human, one could never know what happens next? No one
would disagree about we do our jobs, so does God. Then let us focus on the job
we could do. At 60, some would retire, some still work, some in jail I
suppose, or die in traffic accidents, I don't know. The thing I am sure about
is, some won't have a chance to celebrate their birthdays as Our President,
who is able to send invitations as many as 2000, enjoys the remarks from his
90-year-old tutor, or takes greeting from his students across Asia. Some had
said, President lives in a big dream, I agree, but his dream will finalize
because of his own will, strong determination and broad vision.

60 years is a circle of life. Now with a newly freshed life, President marches
on.
