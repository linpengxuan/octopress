the confidence is a strange things, which could be squeezed into a small one
or pumped larger and larger without any materilization.

things exactly happen this way recently. i took lsat, expecting for a higher
score. with the back of that, i told myself there would be in no way something
stuck on my way ahead. just days later, this unrealistic dream was broken by
some refusal letters from law firms. i did great in this week's presentation,
i did great in contract law class, but neither does them help. now it turns
that i am a small frog in a well looking up into a sky only as large as the
rim of this well. and that is it!

it took me 9 hours to send those self recommendation letter to the law firms
in my wishing list. it is ok, at least i will learn something, that i will and
have to tailor myself to the needs of employers and also keep an eye on time.
