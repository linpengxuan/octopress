Things are always unexpected.


Nice to meet you, Joko said. Me too, I replied with a hand shaking with his.
He is the one gonna leave tomorrow for Indonesia, also the one never come back
for his graduate degree, which just will cost less than 5 months.


Everything got a reason. Though I don’t know and I don’t want to know why, I
respect what he chooses to do. People have right to do what they want to,
don’t they?


For me, what left is no more than sad. He makes fun of me, he tells jokes, he
is humor and with an incredible ability of English speaking. That is what I
thought of him at first. Then at second, he leaves. Probably never see him
again.Why am I so sad? Why to a friend even don’t know his full name.


When there is a start, an end is due. The time matters only.


Farewell. My international friend.
