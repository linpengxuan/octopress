It has been a while since I had this updated last time.

Also a long time I abandoning the English journal as well. Something must go
wrong, I just can’t tell.

Am I getting lazy? You bet I am, sir. I always run out of the time yet still
wondering what I have done when looking back. Wield and paradoxical, things
got to be changed.

Time is flying, I am wondering. Look at me, what I did today. Watched two
movies, spent a large amount of so called voluntarily time on the conversation
programmes, restarted my machine 4 times just wanted to have my files printed
more quickly, which due to the ink, I have to reprint them again. It is among
those dog shits my life is carrying on.

What a wonderful world.
