Life is too short to be sad; Kristin answered me when I wondered why she
always kept smiling and beautiful.

Mmhh. I am different case from her. I felt so sad the time they left. Yes, all
of them left. You know what I did in lunch time, I told all of them, nice
working with you, and shake handed with them. You will never treasure this
kind of moment until suddenly you found yourself was totally being left alone.
My students left, some of who even stopped their cars just to say goodbye to
me, Ice left, who is my so called girlfriend and who I also did not have
chance to send off, Kristin, the red hair Canadian beauty is about to leave
tomorrow, and I am doubting if I really have chance to see this lovely lady
again.

They promised me they would come back on weekend camp or next winter camp. But
who knows? Life is just like a box of chocolate, you never know what it is
going to taste.

I was sad.

Not any more.

Still, life is too short to be sad.
