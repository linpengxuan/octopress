I will open a new column, try to share the experience I gained from using
computer. these tips are not necessary for u to master, but if u do, computer
would be a better friend to you.

  
tips. 1.

do below.

  
basically, two ways.

  
1, easy one. go to the picture you want to post, select it and u will see the
color of pic changes, that means u successfully select it. then press Ctrl-C

2, open a new entry in your blog.

3, press Ctrl-V.
