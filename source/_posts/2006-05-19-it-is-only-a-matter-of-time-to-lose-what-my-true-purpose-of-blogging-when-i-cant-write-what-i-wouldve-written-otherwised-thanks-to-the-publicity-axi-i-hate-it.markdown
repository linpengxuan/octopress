I was trying to show some cool music of price of egypt to Dung, and I told him
I got that movie, do you like to watch it.

and he said yes, oh you still have that, after I have finished my
dissertation.

  
woa. come on, he is never going to finish his dissertation.......

  
我想说我同意大家的看法。不知到还有什么时候，能够让我还能在这样的校园中开怀大笑，我一定很怀念这里的感觉，不为其他，只为那些关心我的兄弟姐妹们。只剩38天了，
还是很珍惜的。因为以后大家上了战场，就连见面的机会也不会有的，甚至一辈子也不会再见了。
