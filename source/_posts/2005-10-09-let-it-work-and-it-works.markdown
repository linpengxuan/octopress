ladies and gentles, you are not gonna believe what i have done. i tried to
install my wireless card in linux which is my favorite choise to windows. but
i failed all the time when system kernel tried to compile source into a mod
that i could use in linux which solely design to my computer. here are the
steps i took

    1, recompile kernel-failed

    2,recompile another kernel -failed

    3,tried using ndiswrapper rather that rt2500, the practice of which i have
made it successful on my gentoo system -damn ,failed again,

    4,i tried to think ,could be my system's too, recompile it. failed.

    5.move onto rt2500,another better choice to my wireless card than
ndiswrapper.

    6 failed to compile

    7,then i start to think by rename the files , maybe i could cheat on the
system.damn,failed again.

8 learn sth from the kernel. when i can't modprobe it ,it just because the
file i compile was basing on the .config in /usr/src/linux/ , which is not
concorde with  my current kernel if you know what i mean.

9 i start to feel frustrated. but retrospecting all the way i have been
throught, no ,i would'nt give up.

10 keep trying. so far , 10 hours has past, and my time leaving for paris seem
to be shorten and shorten

11. googling sth and given the fact i could find lspci name in gentoo but not
here in arch, i start to figure could it be this problem, i switch to gentoo
and think maybe the rt2500.ko there could applied to arch....failed again.

12.then i start to research on the gentoo ebuild , what really surprise me is
there is an patch to pci_name. and that suddenly reminds me , i got hope.

13 by patching to system myself without any guide or instruction, yes, i
finally make my wireless card working on my computer. and i made it.

  
card is rt2500. solely design to linux. and i am happy ..hahahahaha...不爱现。
