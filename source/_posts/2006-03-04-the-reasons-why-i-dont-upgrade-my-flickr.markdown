@page {size:21cm 29.7cm;margin:2cm;} P {margin-bottom:0.21cm;} 1, I haven't
made any money yet.

2, I believe everything should be free from Internet.

3, I haven't broken the rule 2. and I don't want to break it.

4, the difference between my account now and a pro is only a matter of
storage, which can be circumvented in other tricky ways. also, I think it is
better to have multiple accounts to organize my fotos along with kflickr.

5, I have to be stable and stick to my principles
